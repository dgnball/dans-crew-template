# Idea: Add CC and BCC capabilities to emails from HubSpot

## Description:
We have a need for the option to add CC and BCC to emails that are sent from HubSpot. There are two important use cases for this:

1. **Use Case 1:** We have a registration form set up on our website. When someone registers, they receive an automated email from us through HubSpot saying "Thank you for registering!". Since we have many different people signing up, it's crucial for us to follow up on that email. If we could add CC to me on the email that is sent out, I could quickly pick up the conversation with the registering lead.

2. **Use Case 2:** If we could add BCC to emails as well, this would provide two great advantages: 
   - HubSpot emails could easily be integrated with almost ANY CRM (ex. Email to CRM option).
   - The content of the email would be added to the CRM (more than just "Sent Subject Line"). 

If anything is unclear, I would love to explain in more detail.
