## Description
We have a need for the option to add CC and BCC to emails that are sent from HubSpot. We have two important use cases for this:

1. **Use case 1:** We have a registration form set up on our website. When someone registers, they receive an automated email from us through HubSpot saying "Thank you for registering!" Since we have many different people signing up, it's crucial for us to follow up on that email. If we could add CC to me on the email that is sent out, I could pick up the conversation with the person registering very quickly. I could simply press "Reply" on the email and continue the conversation with the lead. If I want to do this now with today's HubSpot solution, I have to copy and paste the lead's email address from the internal registration confirmation email, write a subject line that wouldn't confuse the lead, and then write the message to the lead. This delays the response time dramatically and takes up substantially more resources.

2. **Use case 2:** If we could add BCC to emails as well, it would give people two great advantages;
   - HubSpot emails could easily be integrated with almost ANY CRM (e.g., Email to CRM option).
   - It would add the contents of the email to the CRM (more than just "Sent Subject Line").

If anything is unclear, I would love to explain in more detail.
